###Todos..

1. Featured image upload to AJAX upload. Maybe this helps (http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/11395/upload-post-thumbnail-from-the-front-end/11400#11400) 
2. Debug Notice (Undefined index: _wpnonce in write-here-edit.php on line 9)
3. Add Update success message after editing the post (Add it on the top of the form in write-here-edit.php)
